# Production Readiness Checklist

## ✅ Completed Production Fixes

### Backend Production Fixes
- ✅ **QR URL Standardization**: All QR codes now point to `/ar/{userId}` consistently
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Enhanced CORS to handle production domains
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Created production environment template
- ✅ **Package.json**: Added build script for Render deployment
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Configured for production security
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Production-ready error responses

### Frontend Production Fixes
- ✅ **Route Parameters**: Fixed `projectId` → `userId` parameter mismatch
- ✅ **API URLs**: All API calls use environment variables
- ✅ **Vite Configuration**: Optimized for production builds
- ✅ **Build Optimization**: Added code splitting and minification
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Created production environment template

### Deployment Configuration
- ✅ **Render Config**: Created `render.yaml` for both frontend and backend
- ✅ **Environment Templates**: Created production environment examples
- ✅ **Deployment Guide**: Comprehensive deployment instructions

## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment
```bash
# Set these environment variables in Render:
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/phygital
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.onrender.com
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=phygital-production
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Set these environment variables in Render:
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.onrender.com
VITE_NODE_ENV=production
```
