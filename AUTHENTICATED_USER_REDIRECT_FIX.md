# Authenticated User Redirect Fix

## Problem
When users were logged in, they were still seeing the homepage instead of being redirected to the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The homepage route (`/`) was always showing the `HomePage` component regardless of authentication status.

## Solution Implemented
Added conditional logic to redirect authenticated users to the dashboard while keeping the homepage for non-authenticated users.

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/App.jsx`

**Before**:
```javascript
function App() {
  const { isLoading } = useAuth()
  
  // ... loading logic ...
  
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<HomePage />} />
          // ... other routes
```

**After**:
```javascript
function App() {
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuth()
  
  // ... loading logic ...
  
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={
            isAuthenticated ? <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace /> : <HomePage />
          } />
          // ... other routes
```

## How It Works

### For Authenticated Users
1. **User visits `/`** (homepage)
2. **System checks `isAuthenticated`** - returns `true`
3. **Redirects to `/dashboard`** using `<Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />`
4. **User sees dashboard** instead of homepage

### For Non-Authenticated Users
1. **User visits `/`** (homepage)
2. **System checks `isAuthenticated`** - returns `false`
3. **Shows homepage** as normal
4. **User sees homepage** with login/register options

## Key Features

✅ **Automatic Redirect**: Authenticated users are automatically redirected to dashboard
✅ **Seamless Experience**: No manual navigation needed
✅ **Preserves Homepage**: Non-authenticated users still see the homepage
✅ **Replace Navigation**: Uses `replace` to prevent back button issues
✅ **Clean URLs**: No redirect loops or URL pollution

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Logged-in users go directly to their dashboard
2. **Logical Flow**: Homepage is for marketing, dashboard is for users
3. **No Confusion**: Users don't see marketing content when they're already logged in
4. **Faster Access**: Direct access to user features and projects

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Authenticated User
1. **Login** to the application
2. **Visit `/`** (homepage URL)
3. **Should redirect** to `/dashboard`
4. **Should see dashboard** content

### ✅ Non-Authenticated User
1. **Visit `/`** (homepage URL)
2. **Should see homepage** with login/register options
3. **No redirect** should occur

### ✅ Direct Dashboard Access
1. **Authenticated user** visits `/dashboard` directly
2. **Should see dashboard** (no redirect needed)
3. **Should work normally**

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added conditional redirect logic
- `AUTHENTICATED_USER_REDIRECT_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Notes

- Uses `replace` prop to replace the current history entry instead of adding a new one
- This prevents users from going "back" to the homepage when they're logged in
- The redirect only happens on the root path (`/`), other routes work normally
- Dashboard route is already protected, so no additional authentication checks needed
